The file [financialTimes_ge2017_dataDictionary.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ft-interactive/ge2017-dataset/master/financialTimes_ge2017_dataDictionary.csv) contains a data dictionary listing all variables in the dataset, the category they belong to, and the data type.

Where applicable, and where data is available, numerators and denominators are provided as well as a percentage figure.

The dataset covers all constituencies in England, Wales and Scotland, though data for some variables is missing for certain constituencies. English and Welsh constituencies have the best data coverage.
